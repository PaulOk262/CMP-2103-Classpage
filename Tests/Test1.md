### 1. Write a function that takes in the x and y co-ordinates of a point and computes the polar co-ordinates in form of magnitude and angle.
### 2. Write a function that rounds of the value of the magnitude and angle to 2 decimal places and thus compute the polar co-ordinates rounded to 2-decimal places
       * Note that the angle should be computed in degrees and not radians.

	-   `O` is misinterpreted as `0`
	-   `I` is misinterpreted as `1`
### Write a function that takes in a string and replaces the errors (numbers) above with the corresponding character.
